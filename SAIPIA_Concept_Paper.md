### **Self-sufficient Artificial Intelligent Raspberry Pi Assistant**

SAIPiA is a self-sufficient system built on a Raspberry Pi that features an AI assistant capable of performing various tasks, including database access, LLMs (Large Language Models), image recognition, speech recognition, and image generation. 

The entire system is housed in a secure case, containing the Raspberry Pi, a display, a keyboard, and other peripherals. It is powered by an internal battery that can be recharged via USB-C. All Raspberry Pi interfaces, including GPIO pins, are accessible. An AI kit is used to optimize tasks for the Raspberry Pi.

## 8. Server and Server Implementation (Dedicated Server)

An external server will be used to support AI functionalities by expanding the computing power. The server processes complex AI models, relieving the Raspberry Pi.

**Server Requirements**  
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or higher
- **Processor**: At least 8 cores
- **RAM**: 16 GB or more
- **Graphics Card**: High-performance GPU (e.g., NVIDIA A100 or RTX 3090)
- **Storage**: ~1 TB SSD for models and data

**Server Implementation**  
1. **Model Hosting**  
   The server hosts larger AI models (e.g., LLAMA3.2) and processes requests from the Raspberry Pi. A smaller model on the Pi determines which requests are sent to the server.

2. **Communication**  
   The Raspberry Pi communicates with the server through a RESTful API. The server processes requests and returns the results.

3. **Load Balancing**  
   Additional server instances are scaled as needed to avoid overloading.

4. **Security Measures**  
   Encryption of all data transmissions and firewall implementation.

5. **Monitoring**  
   Tools like Prometheus monitor the server's state (CPU, RAM, GPU).

**Benefits of the Server Architecture**  
By integrating a server, the overall systemâ€™s processing power is significantly increased. Computationally intensive tasks are delegated to the server, while the Raspberry Pi handles local processes and simpler tasks.

### 8.1 School AI Server

The school's AI server is provided for development and testing of AI models. It offers higher computing power than the self-hosted server, allowing the use of powerful models. The advantage is that the server is already available and incurs no additional costs. However, since multiple users share the server, resources must be divided, which may lead to longer wait times and fluctuations in performance.
