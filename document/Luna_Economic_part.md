**Research Question**  
In the context of our project, we aim to explore the influence of Open Source on the economy and its broader implications for economic systems. This includes examining how Open Source technologies contribute to innovation, cost efficiency, and collaboration within various industries. Given that our project heavily relies on Open Source tools and frameworks, we also seek to analyze the advantages, challenges, and potential economic impacts associated with adopting and integrating Open Source solutions. Through this investigation, we aim to determine how Open Source shapes economic dynamics and assess its relevance in the context of modern technological development.
