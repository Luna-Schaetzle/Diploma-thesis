\label{cha:Introduction_to_the_used_AI_Models}

For the Diploma thesis, there are many different AI models that are in use. There are different Types of AI models, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item LLMs (Large Language Models)
    \item Defusion Models (Models that are used to create images)
    \item Object Detection Models (Models that are used to detect objects in images)
    \item Face Recognition Models (Models that are used to recognize faces in images)
