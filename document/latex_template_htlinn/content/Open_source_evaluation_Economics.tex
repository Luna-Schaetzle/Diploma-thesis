\section{Introduction}

\subsection{What is Open Source?}

Open Source represents a collaborative and transparent approach to software development and distribution, 
where the source code is made publicly accessible. This philosophy empowers users not only to utilize the software but also to modify, 
improve, and redistribute it freely. By fostering an environment of openness and collaboration, 
Open Source drives innovation and democratizes access to technology.

Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system, encapsulated this spirit of freedom and collaboration with his famous remark:

\begin{quote}
    \textit{“Software is like sex: it's better when it's free.”}
    \author{Linus Torvalds}
\end{quote}

\cite{Linus_Torvalds_quote_open_source}

\section{What is and isn’t Open Source?}

\subsection{Definition and Guiding Principles}

Open Source, as defined by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), is a development approach that prioritizes accessibility and transparency of software source code. It allows users to view, modify, and distribute the code freely, fostering collaboration and innovation. 

The OSI outlines several key principles that define Open Source software:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Free Redistribution:} The software can be freely shared and distributed without restrictions.
    \item \textbf{Source Code Access:} Users must have access to the source code to study, modify, and improve the software.
    \item \textbf{Modification and Sharing:} Users are allowed to create and share modified versions, as long as they follow the license terms.
    \item \textbf{No Discrimination:} The software must be available for everyone, regardless of individual characteristics or professional field.
    \item \textbf{Neutrality and Compatibility:} The license must not favor specific technologies or restrict the use of other software.
\end{itemize}

These principles ensure that Open Source remains a transparent, inclusive, and adaptable approach to software development, enabling innovation and collaboration across industries and communities.

\cite{Open_Source_Initiative_OS_definition}

\subsection{Misconceptions About Open Source}

Open Source is often misunderstood and confused with other software distribution models, which can lead to misconceptions about its nature, functionality, and benefits. 
It is crucial to distinguish Open Source from other types of software:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Open Source:} Software that is freely accessible, modifiable, and redistributable under an Open Source license, adhering to principles such as transparency and collaboration.
    \item \textbf{Freeware:} Software available at no cost but typically without access to the source code, meaning users cannot modify or redistribute it.
    \item \textbf{Proprietary Software:} Software owned and controlled by a single entity, restricting access to the source code and preventing users from making modifications or redistributions.
    \item \textbf{Commercial Software:} Software sold for profit, which may be either Open Source or proprietary, depending on the licensing terms.
\end{itemize}

Understanding these distinctions helps users make informed choices about software selection and ensures their expectations align with the capabilities and freedoms provided by the chosen software.

To verify whether a software is truly Open Source, it is essential to examine the license agreement and confirm the availability of the source code. 
Software with an OSI-approved license is a reliable indicator that it adheres to Open Source principles, providing transparency, freedom, and collaboration opportunities.

One common misconception about Open Source software arises from the phrase "free as in freedom" versus "free as in free beer."  
While "free as in freedom" emphasizes the liberty to access, modify, and share the software, "free as in free beer" simply denotes that the software is free of cost. 
Although Open Source software is often available without charge, its true value lies in the freedoms it grants to users, developers, and organizations. 
This distinction highlights the broader significance of Open Source as a philosophy, not just a pricing model.
